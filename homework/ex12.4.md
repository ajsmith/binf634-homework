# Exercise 12.4

Perform a BLAST search on the NCBI website.


# Report

To accomplish this, I did the following:

1.  Went to the GenBank site: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/

2.  Searched for an example sequence. In this case I searched for
    "Homo sapiens ubiquitin C".

3.  I selected the 2nd result which had the accession number
    "AB643790.1", and I clicked the FASTA link to view its sequence.

4.  On the right hand side of the page, I clicked the "Run BLAST"
    link, which brought me to the NCBI BLASTN search form. The
    accession number, "AB643790.1", was prepopulated.

5.  Leaving all other form options at their defaults, I clicked the
    "BLAST" button at the bottom of the form.

6.  The BLASTN search produced 100 results.
